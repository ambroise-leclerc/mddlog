# ADR-004: Audit persistence and tamper evidence

## Status
Proposed — **the least developed of the four records.** It exists to bound what may be claimed while
the design is open, and to hold the open questions in one place. Several decisions below are
deliberately left unanswered and marked as such; do not read an unanswered question as a permissive
default.

## Context

`README.md` promises, under Audit Trail Features, "Tamper-proof records with cryptographic
signatures" and, under Medical Device Compliance, "Regulatory Reporting: Automated compliance report
generation" — both marked `(planned)`. Nothing implements either.

ADR-002 Decision 3 defines a three-level delivery contract — admitted, handed off, durably confirmed
— and states that **no backend offers level 3 today**, leaving that level in the contract purely so a
future record has somewhere to attach. This is that record's slot. mddlog issue #5 likewise excludes
"persistent/cryptographically protected audit storage" from its own scope.

Two constraints from the earlier records shape everything here:

- **Key material and storage cannot live in the governed core.** ADR-001 confines the governed zone
  to non-allocating, non-throwing, non-blocking code with no filesystem or OS surface. Reading a key,
  writing a file, and flushing to durable media are none of those things. Persistence is therefore an
  adapter/host concern by construction, not by preference.
- **The word matters.** "Tamper-proof" claims prevention. Nothing a logging library can do prevents
  someone with write access to the medium from altering or deleting records. What is achievable is
  **tamper-evident**: alteration or truncation becomes detectable after the fact. This record adopts
  the second word and recommends the README be corrected to match before anything here ships.

## Medical Device Considerations

- **Post-market reconstruction** is the purpose: an audit trail earns its cost when someone must
  reconstruct, months later, what a deployed device did. That requires records that survive restart
  and that a reader can check for completeness — not only for content.
- **Detection is not prevention, and both are the manufacturer's problem, not the library's.** A
  hash chain shows that a sequence was altered or truncated; it does not stop it, and it does not
  establish who wrote a record unless a key binds it. Access control over the medium, key custody,
  and device-level physical security sit with the manufacturer's own risk file.
- **A gap must read as a gap.** ADR-002 Decision 5 gives every event a stream identity and a
  per-stream sequence; the persistence format must preserve both, so that a restart, a lost segment
  or a deliberate excision is visible as a discontinuity rather than silently closing up.

## Decision

### 1. Tamper-evident, never "tamper-proof"

The claim this project may make, once implemented, is: *alteration or truncation of a stored audit
sequence is detectable by a reader holding the chain state.* It is not a prevention claim, not an
authorship claim without key binding, and not a claim about records that never reached storage.
README's "tamper-proof" wording should be corrected independently of whether this record is accepted.

### 2. Hash chaining over a canonical serialization is the minimum mechanism

Each stored record carries a digest over (its canonical bytes ‖ the previous record's digest), so
that altering or removing any record breaks every subsequent link. This is the smallest mechanism
that delivers Decision 1 without key management, and it is deliberately chosen as the floor rather
than the ceiling: signing (Decision 3) can be layered on later without changing the record format.

Two prerequisites this record inherits rather than invents:

- a **canonical** serialization — same record, same bytes, on every toolchain. MduX's
  ADR-007 pipeline exists for exactly this reason (sorted keys, no locale-dependent formatting, and
  floats as bit patterns rather than decimal text); mddlog cannot import it but should not re-derive
  the lesson from scratch either;
- the stream identity and per-stream sequence from ADR-002 Decision 5, so a chain is scoped to a
  stream and a restart begins a new, explicitly linked chain rather than appearing continuous.

### 3. Signing is deferred again, and the reason is key custody

Binding a chain to a device identity requires a private key on the device, which requires answering
where it is stored, how it is provisioned, how it is rotated, and what happens when it is
compromised. None of those are logging questions, and a wrong answer is worse than a missing one.
This record therefore specifies the chain and leaves signing to a later decision, with the record
format required to leave room for a signature over the chain head.

### 4. Open questions, stated rather than defaulted

These are unresolved. An implementation must not pick silently:

- **Storage medium and layout** — segmented files, a circular region of flash, or an
  append-only device log. Each has a different truncation and wear story.
- **Power-loss atomicity** — what "durably confirmed" (ADR-002 level 3) means precisely: written,
  flushed, or acknowledged by the medium. Until this is answered, level 3 stays unclaimed.
- **Retention and rotation** — how a bounded medium ages out old records without making the chain
  unverifiable, and what a reader sees at the boundary.
- **Chain state recovery** — where the last digest lives across a restart, and what a reader
  concludes when it is missing or inconsistent.
- **Export format** — the "automated compliance report generation" README claims; likely a separate
  record again, since an export format is read by tools nobody here controls.

### 5. Nothing about this record changes the claims allowed today

Until it is implemented and verified, ADR-002 Decision 3 stands unchanged: mddlog promises in-memory
admission only, and power loss is outside every guarantee. This record's existence is not evidence of
a capability, which is the same caution the index applies to every Proposed record.

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Signed records from the start, no separate chaining step (Rejected for now)
**Pros:** One mechanism, stronger claim, no migration from chain-only to chain-plus-signature.
**Cons:** Blocks all persistence on key custody (Decision 3). Chaining delivers the detectable-
alteration property immediately and leaves the format open for signatures.

### 2. Rely on the storage medium's own integrity (Rejected)
**Pros:** No work in the library; filesystems and flash controllers already detect corruption.
**Cons:** They detect *accidental* corruption. They do not detect a deliberate, well-formed
rewrite, which is the case an audit trail exists for.

### 3. Persist every log record, not only audit events (Rejected)
**Pros:** One path; no decision about what deserves durability.
**Cons:** Volume. Diagnostics at debug level on a busy device would dominate the medium and force
retention policies that then age out the audit records too. ADR-002's separation of audit from
severity exists precisely so this choice can be made once, correctly.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Gives ADR-002's third delivery level a named home instead of an open-ended promise.
- Replaces "tamper-proof" with a claim that can actually be verified, before any code exists to
  overclaim about.
- Keeps key custody out of a logging decision.

### Negative
- Chaining adds a per-record digest computation on the persistence path and a verification step for
  any reader; neither is free.
- Leaving five questions open (Decision 4) means this record cannot be implemented as it stands — it
  bounds the design rather than settling it.

### Risks and Mitigations
- **The record is read as a plan rather than a boundary.** *Mitigation*: Status and Decision 5 both
  say what it is; the index marks it Proposed like the rest.
- **A chain is treated as proof of authorship.** *Mitigation*: Decision 1 states what the claim is
  and is not, in the words to use.
- **Canonical serialization is re-derived badly.** *Mitigation*: Decision 2 names the prerequisite
  and points at MduX ADR-007 for the failure modes (locale, float formatting, key ordering) rather
  than leaving an implementer to rediscover them.
